CUDD versions from  David Kebo Tutorials

Install `autotools` (`autoconf` and `automake`in Fedora) in case of `aclocal-1.14 is missing on your system` problem while `./configure`.

Using other repositories, also encountered problem while executing `make`. Using `./configure --enable-dddmp --enable-obj --enable-shared --enable-static; make` only partially solved the problem. When using this `tar.gz` solved problems when using the `make` command exiting. 
On the other hand, using these `.tar.gz` presented no problems.
